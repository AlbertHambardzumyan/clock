# clock
Clock application implementation.


## Introduction

We provide two versions of simple clock application. The first one is a bit simpler than the other one. It starts from 
 initial default time rather than the current time, has 2 arms instead of 3 and GUI is simple. Both applications use 
 threads, but the second one does more.
 
Clock applications we consider:
